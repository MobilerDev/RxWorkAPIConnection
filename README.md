## Repository Information


 Our application will draw value from two APIs that I have created myself, which give the names, logos, populations of countries and the most populous cities of those countries, and give the names, logos and populations of the continents and the most populous cities of those continents. Then, changes will be made on these values ​​and final values ​​will be created for graphic display. Finally, a graphical comparison of these two values ​​will be made by combining these two values ​​in a single Worker.
